# MovieFinder
'Free to Me' is an application to provide the user with information regarding if the movie they're considering is already available in one of the users' current video subscriptions. The user simply enters the movie they'd like to watch, after checking off their current subscriptions to online video services, and they will be presented with viewing options that are already free to them. Conversely it will return the condition if they do not having any free viewing options. Each movie requested will return with it recommended viewing choices based on their entry and related movie data. All related movies will allow the user to click on that choice to see further recommendations. Movie data will include; rating, year released, genre, critic's ratings and viewer ratings.
